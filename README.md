# Invasion_PGF
tools for applying PGF functions to invasive processes, in particular infectious disease.


The documentation can be found in the folder docs/_build/html.  Start
with index.html.


This requires odeintw https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/odeintw which
currently is not automatically installed.  I plan to change this, but
for now you must install it either in the same directory at
Invasion_PGF or in your python path.

It also requires numpy.
